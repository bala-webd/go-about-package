# go-about-package
Today, In my Free time, just learnt about how we need to access the files from different directory, like a local pacakges.

1. Created a directory called test inside my project directory.
2. In this project, we need to utilize this test directory as package and import at anywhere in the project.
3. So that test.go contains a function which we are going to use it in anywhere in the project.
4. Gonna create my module which is named as test.
5. So via test module we can access the packages (directories) inside our project.
6. Added my import in my main file.
7. With that import i have used a function which is written in test package.

Simple!!!! I am beginning buddy who is exploring golang.
